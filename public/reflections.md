# Q1 Reflection
### Elijah Gabriel Gamis

## Topics that I Know Very Well
1. I understood **While and Do-While Loops** very easily since they were essentially the same as Whiles and Do-Whiles in C++. I had lots of practice with C++ last year, so figuring out how to do these types of loops was second nature to me.

2. I found **Variable Declaration** to be extremely simple in JS compared to C++. At first I was skeptical because it seemed too simple, but now I don't mind, as not having to think about the variable type allows me to focus on more important problems.

3. **I/O Statements** were very simple. They were extremely similar to I/O Statements in Python, which was my grade 7 programming language. However, they also had a wider range of use, which is always good.

4. The way **formatted strings** work in JS is one of my favorite things about the programming language. It is the perfect combination of simple, specific, and quick. Compared to making a *"formatted"* string in C++, where I would have to write something like `cout << "String" << Var << "\n";`, JS lets me write in one go, without making any breaks.

5. **Switch Statements**, like the While and Do-While loops, was a topic I could immediately grasp. This is attributed to me learning it in C++ last year, and it *definitely* helped that Switch statements were one of my favorites.


## Topics that I Need Further Practice On
1. I still don't fully understand **For Loops**, specifically post-test for loops. I was kind of absent during the meeting we discussed it, and I also hadn't encountered post-test for loops last year. I never got around to studying them, so I still don't really understand how they work, even till now.

2. **Comparison Operators** are the bane of my JS journey. I can't wrap my head around whatever `Hello` and `Hi` mean. I don't think I was focusing on the lesson when we learned this, which is why I have a hard time with them. Yes, some comparison operators are the same in C++, but JS took it to the next level, and I haven't started learning them yet.

3. I have a pretty hard time with **HTML Tags**. I've learned how to use them way back before the pandemic, but the meaning of some of the tags' abbreviations has been lost to me, making them seem arbitrary.

4. It is a bit hard for me to remember **How to Link JS Files in HTML**, especially when I need to do it efficiently. Whenever I look at the question, `"What is the most efficient way to import a JavaScript file into HTML?"`, I just end up guessing.

5. The broadest topic that I have trouble with is **Debugging**. I'd rather rewrite the entire script rather than spend time trying to understand the thought process of the programmer. Whenever I try to understand, it just makes me more confused.


## Plan of Action
```
if(topic.scale == "Small"){
    consult("https://www.w3schools.com/");
    obsidian.takenotes(topic);
}
else if(topic.scale == "Large"){
    if(weekday == "Saturday" || weekday == "Sunday"){
        consult("father");
    }
    else{
        consult("Ma'am Aline");
    }
    obsidian.takenotes(topic);
}
consult(obsidian.notes(topic));
```


## Effective Activities
1. **Speed Tests** are fun and effective activities, as they both test our problem-solving skills while also making things more competitive, an element adolescent minds thrive under.

2. **Home Graded Activities** are more geared towards finding innovative solutions, training our brains to think outside the box.

3. **Practical Long Tests** Combine the creativity taught by home graded activities with the time pressure of speed tests, testing the extent of our knowledge and problem-solving skills.


## Non-Effective Activities
1. **Debugging Tasks** weren't as effective for me, as I usually ended up rewriting the program entirely. If it were up to me, I'd have a lesson on how to understand and debug someone else's code.

2. Activities like our **GitHub & VSCode Setup** were a bit boring for me. While necessary, I already understood how to set up, so I didn't really need to use a period for it. I would rather use online messaging in order to clarify specific questions, and maybe have an online consultation meeting for students who are *really* having a hard time understanding how to do it.
